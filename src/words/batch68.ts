Syn. -- To cover; cloak; hide; extenuate; conceal. -- To Palliate, Extenuate, Cloak. These words, as here compared, are used in a figurative sense in reference to our treatment of wrong action.

This naturally leads us to soften some of its features, and thus palliate approaches extenuate till they have become nearly or quite identical. \"To palliate is not now used, though it once was, in the sense of wholly cloaking or covering over, as it might be, our sins, but in that of extenuating; to palliate our faults is not to hide them altogether, but to seek to diminish their guilt in part.\" Trench.","endecaphyllous":"Composed of eleven leaflets; -- said of a leaf.","ineye":"To ingraft, as a tree or plant, by the insertion of a bud or eye; to inoculate.
