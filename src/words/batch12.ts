Amidst denotes in the midst or middle of, and hence surrounded by; as, this work was written amidst many interruptions. Among denotes a mingling or intermixing with distinct or separable objects; as, \"He fell among thieves.\" \"Blessed art thou among women.\" Hence, we say, among the moderns, among the ancients, among the thickest of trees, among these considerations, among the reasons I have to offer.

Hence, we say, they kept on amidst the storm, amidst the gloom, he was sinking amidst the waves, he persevered amidst many difficulties; in none of which cases could among be used. In like manner, Milton speaks of Abdiel, -- The seraph Abdiel, faithful found; Among the faithless faithful only he, because he was then considered as one of the angels.
